# Scala.js Pickling

This project aims at providing a pickling mechanism for Scala.js (aka
serialization), with a weak inspiration from
[Scala Pickling](https://github.com/scala/pickling).

Its main purpose is to support cross-worker and client-server communication
in the context of [Scala.js actors](https://github.com/sjrd/scala-js-actors).
